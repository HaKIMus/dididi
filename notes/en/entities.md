# Entities

__Validation__

Only because an object consists of valid attributes (on a per-basis), does not necessary mean the object (as a whole) is valid. Vice versa, valid objects do not necessarily mean we have valid compositions.

__Presistence mechanism genereting identity__

This solution has a major drawback: We won't have the identity of the entity untill we persist it.
